There are more email addresses than Facebook accounts, statistics say they are around 2 billion (!) however there are security issues to be considered. Îœalevolent users are trying to collect as many email addresses as possible and try to sell them as legitimate mailing lists.

So, how can you protect your email address from hackers?

  * Choose a very strong password (long and mixed with numbers, upper case and special characters)
  * Do NOT post it openly in forums, social media sites and chat rooms
  * Hide it using entities or javascript (special article coming soon)

Keep them safe!
