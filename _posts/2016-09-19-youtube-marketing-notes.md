I recently took a youtube marketing course, just wanted to see how all these marketers are making so much money while uploading videos to the popular video streaming site.

The instructor was advertising that you can even make money without any original content of yours, so the clickbait worked 🙂 and it was cheap ($10) so why not.

I made some notes on paper that they&#8217;ve been hanging around on different places of my desk for quite some time now, therefore I decided to put them online and throw the paper (it started getting really dirty as well).

* * *

### Introduction

SocialBlade.com -> statistics, analysis and earnings

#### Always Edit the Videos

  * Add Title
  * Edit Videos
  * Combine Relevant Videos

Don&#8217;t use the music ? from the Editor, only ad-free and available for monetisation.

### Content

  *  Keywords in the beginning
  * Longer descriptions work
  * Put links in the description
  * Lots of tags / phrases
  * ? Go back to old films and add / change stuff
  * Actual order of the tags is not relevant
  * Add a special tag for relevant films that is simple, unique and long ▶️ helps with related
  * Nice and clear thumbnail ▶️ Big letter &#8211; don&#8217;t use bottom right corner

### Annotations

  * Very important tool for cross selling, subscriptions etc  &#8211; at the end of the video send them to the next one
  * Speech bubble (someone&#8217;s talking)
  * Note
  * Spotlight ▶️ links an area

### Playlists

  * Can have quite a few
  * Using a playlist, next film will play (better be yours ?)

### Channel Settings

  * Private by default
  * Common tags
  * Invisible statistics
  * Invideo Programming ▶️ Add a branding watermark ▶️ Featured playlist (at the end)
  * Fan finder ▶️ Free ad from Youtube, create a trailer
  * ? End slate ▶️ Text box with a link at the end leading to the subscription page ▶️ Save a video as an End Slate and publish it as private, can then drag it at the end of the film ▶️ Add an annotation to link to subscribe page (spotlight)

### Analytics

  * Understand your demo graphics (country, age, sex) and use the appropriate tone
  * Device segmentation
  * Audience retention is the most important ▶️ Don&#8217;t count only views ▶️ How many minutes watched? ▶️ Where do people pause / leave?
  * More views ≠ More money ⚠️
  * Engagement reports
  * Viewers from small countries don&#8217;t make money
  * Dislikes are not necessarily negative

### Video Licensing

  * Creative Commons ▶️ Attribution License
  * T.A.S.L Rule &#8211; **T**itle, **A**uthor, **S**ource, **L**icense  
    e.g This video features &#8220;My elephant&#8221; (http://www.vimeo.com/&#8230;) bu John Smith which is licensed under CC BY http://creativecommons.org/&#8230;
  * Vimeo Advanced Filters &#8211; HD Quality + is downloadable

And this is it!

There&#8217;s still a lot of work involved if you want to make money from youtube marketing, but some tips actually make sense and you can use them to enhance your existing videos and youtube presence.
