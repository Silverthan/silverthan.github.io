Continuing the mini interviews with web and email marketing professionals, this week I had the pleasure to interview [Jaina Mistry](http://jainamistry.com/).

Jaina is an experienced email marketing professional from the UK, currently based in Bahrain and working remotely for a start-up in London. She also enjoys photography and a good film. You can read more about her at her personal blog [time-wellspent.com](http://time-wellspent.com/) or say hello [on twitter](https://twitter.com/jainamistry) where she&#8217;s a regular on the #emailgeeks hashtag and not only.

Let&#8217;s see what did we talk about:

### What is your favorite email app?

This is a bit of a strange one, but I don&#8217;t actually have one. I use Gmail via Chrome when I&#8217;m on my laptop and also the Gmail app on my Nexus 4. Yes, it&#8217;s terrible at rendering email, but I still find it incredibly useful for the actual email side of things. Perhaps I just need to be enlightened.

### Can you share the homescreen of your iPhone / Android phone?<figure id="attachment_876" style="width: 614px" class="wp-caption alignnone">

Here it is. Nothing spectacular &#8211; stock android with my most used apps right in front of me. My backgrounds are via the app [Muzei](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.nurik.roman.muzei) and the clock is [Timely&#8217;s clock ](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ch.bitspin.timely).

### Email coding can some times be a pain. What is the most common / favourite hack you use in your templates.

One hack I use pretty much every single day is Actionrocket Lab&#8217;s [Ghost Column hack](http://labs.actionrocket.co/make_mobile_email_work_in_outlook) &#8211; a lot of our customers still use Outlook 2007-13 and this one is pretty much indispensable for me. Oh and, to get around Gmail&#8217;s issue the min-width fix to force the width of container tables.

### Email is (not) dead. How do you see the future for the email marketing professionals?

It&#8217;s just going to get bigger. Years ago, I started out in web design and development. Where you were a web designer and a jack of all trades. Quickly, the web design field started to get very fragmented with all sorts of specialities popping up. I feel like that&#8217;s exactly what&#8217;s happening with email marketing at the moment with people specialising in just the design, build, accessibility, deliverability, copy writing, etc. It&#8217;s pretty exciting.

### You&#8217;re into photography as well. Do you have a special workflow for the organization of your pics. What apps / platforms do you use for editing / publishing?

<img class="alignnone wp-image-878 size-large" src="http://silverthan.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/photo-1024x680.jpg" alt="photo" width="1024" height="680" srcset="http://silverthan.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/photo-1024x680.jpg 1024w, http://silverthan.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/photo-300x200.jpg 300w, http://silverthan.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/photo.jpg 1500w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /> 

On my camera, I shoot everything in RAW &#8211; I like having the extra control over editing my photos. I&#8217;ve been using Lightroom to edit the photos for a few years now. My workflow&#8217;s nothing out of the ordinary &#8211; import the photos onto my Macbook, open them up in Lightroom and begin the cull. Not long ago, I used to keep almost all photos I took &#8211; even ones I knew weren&#8217;t great. _Just in case_. Whatever the _just in case_ might have been!

But these days I&#8217;m a lot stricter with myself and do maybe 3 passes on one import to really nail down and find the good photos in whatever I&#8217;ve been shooting. Learning you have to be really critical in photography to really grow in it. Once I&#8217;ve picked out the photos I upload to Google+ Photos. What can I say, I&#8217;m a faithful Googler. It&#8217;s the ease of use &#8211; I can get at these photos wherever I need, once I&#8217;ve uploaded them to G+ Photos.

On my phone (Nexus 4) I use the stock Android camera and depending on the photo I&#8217;ll either edit with Snapseed or VSCO. VSCO&#8217;s a fairly new discovery for me, and enjoying it so far. In terms of publishing, every day snapshots go up on <a href="http://instagram.com/jaina.mistry" target="_blank">Instagram</a>, which is mostly what I use my N4&#8217;s camera for. It&#8217;s a terrible camera! Looking forward to getting my hands on a new phone with a much improved camera system.

### You currently work remotely. How was the transition from the normal office to your own space? Do you have any tips / tools that would be useful to other remote workers?

Strangely, it was fairly easy transitioning from a normal office to my own space. I&#8217;m pretty good at getting into the &#8220;working&#8221; mindset wherever I am. Once I&#8217;ve clocked-in to working hours, I&#8217;m on the job. Though there are some weeks when I never leave home, save for going to the gym, and by the weekend cabin fever can set in.

<p dir="ltr">
  Remote working definitely isn&#8217;t for everyone. Though if you want to give it a go, you have to be incredibly disciplined. I think that&#8217;s the biggest part of remote working. Only you can hold yourself accountable and that has to be enough. Take regular breaks. It&#8217;s easy to work remotely from the morning to lunch time and not take a break. Get up and walk around a little bit every hour or so. On the topic of taking breaks &#8211; if you work to a set of office hours (As I do.) make sure you&#8217;ve got some sort of structure to your day. I try to make sure I get up a couple of hours before I have to start work &#8211; I&#8217;ll try to hit the gym before work, have a good breakfast and just sit and read while I eat. No screens, no emails, just some non-work alone time. In the evening I make sure that when I&#8217;ve finished with work, I really am<i> finished</i> with work. Wind down at the gym or just get away from my desk.

As for tools, I&#8217;ve tried in vain to get the team using the likes of Asana and Trello, however it&#8217;s hard to get everyone onboard! We rely a lot on Google Docs for sync&#8217;d documents. Skype is the day-to-day communication app. Though with the entire business using Google, we&#8217;re slowly transitioning to Google Hangouts. I like to use Evernote to keep track of what I&#8217;ve done in a day and what I&#8217;ve got to do. Just some simple notes and checklists help me keep on track.

### For most people, thinking of Bahrain brings images of luxury, fast cars and oil. How&#8217;s the daily life like?

Haha! Daily life is a little different. Of course you do see the luxury and the fast cars. But I find every day life here in Bahrain not that dissimilar to when I was back in the UK. Some things are easier and some are harder. English is widely spoken, so I&#8217;ve not struggled there! Food deliveries come at all hours and from all sorts of places. I can eat amazingly tasty meals for next to nothing or pay through my nose for it. Over 50% of the population of Bahrain are expats from the Philippines, India, Bangladesh, USA, UK and more &#8211; a lot of different cultures all mixing in here. The country&#8217;s got an incredibly relaxed feeling to it &#8211; which can be nice. It&#8217;s a welcome change from the pace of life in London.

However it can get frustrating when you need to get things done and no one&#8217;s working to your timetable. Then there&#8217;s the Internet. Yes, some websites are filtered here. That rarely impacts my day-to-day life, however the speed of the Internet does, especially working remotely. While I&#8217;ve got a lovely 4G router, speeds are rarely anything like you&#8217;d get on a 4G contract in the UK. Especially when the weekends hit (Which are Fridays and Saturdays here.) &#8211; I have to make an effort not to schedule any meetings on Fridays as I know I&#8217;ll just be competing with everyone else enjoying their weekend Internet time.

### Any advice for your 18yo self?

Plans are great. In theory. They give yourself something to work towards. A goal. And everyone needs a goal. But don&#8217;t freak out if the plan doesn&#8217;t quite come together. Plans aren&#8217;t definite. They&#8217;re flexible. Oh, and you&#8217;re more adaptable than you give yourself credit for. And don&#8217;t forget to look after your knees!
