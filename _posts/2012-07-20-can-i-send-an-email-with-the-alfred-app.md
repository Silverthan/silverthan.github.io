The Alfred App is a great way to improve your workflow if your working on a Mac. Its features will help you boost your productivity and reduce the time you spend for your day to day tasks.

But can you send an email directly from the Alfred App?Â Yes you can!

However it is only included in the powerpack version and you will have to pay for it.

Is it worth it?
