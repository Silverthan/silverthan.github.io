Many people work in Dreamweaver, not because it is cheap, but because their company bought the Adobe Suite. For daily html development and especially for working with templates in multiple languages, Dreamweaver actually does a pretty good job.

#### Every section should be a table

When coding a newsletter with multiple articles in the same format, it is better to have each section as a table in order to be able to copy / transfer it with a simple select in design view.

#### Center everything in the beggining

Instead of centering every single table, we should just put the <center> attribute in the very beginning (just after the body) and close it at the end.

#### Split view and Paste Special

While working in Dreamweaver, the optimal setup is the split view. This way we can see in real time the changes we&#8217;re making when we&#8217;re hand-coding and take advantage of the design view, where we can select a table or a td or a specific textarea, much quicker than going through the code.

#### Name your links for easier analytics

Don&#8217;t forget to name all your links with different names. This will make analytics, clickthrough&#8217;s and broken links much easier to find.
