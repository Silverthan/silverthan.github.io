We have talked before about [using fonts in your html email templates](http://www.55emails.com/google-fonts-in-html-emails/ "Google fonts in html emails"). Custom fonts are not ESP friendly, so we have to play with the web-safe fonts.

Below is a list of these fonts that will always display correctly in your email.

  * Verdana
  * Arial
  * Helvetica
  * Comic Sans
  * Impact
  * Tahoma
  * Trebuchet
  * Courier New
  * Lucida Console

If you really want to use custom special typography, you have to do it through static images.
