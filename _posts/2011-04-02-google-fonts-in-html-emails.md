Many people would pay good money to be able to use custom fonts in their html emails, however this is not possible at the moment. There are only a few clients (like Thunderbird&#8230;) that we can actually see the custom font, but their market-share is too low to take into consideration.

There you have it then, no custom fonts for html emails.
