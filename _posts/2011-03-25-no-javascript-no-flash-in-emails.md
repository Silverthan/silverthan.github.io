All ESP&#8217;s will block our emails in case there is any javascript in our source. This is done mostly for security reasons as unfortunately &#8216;bad&#8217; people can take advantage of the security vulnerabilities.

Same thing applies for Flash, the object will not display at all if we&#8217;re lucky and it doesn&#8217;t go directly to spam.
